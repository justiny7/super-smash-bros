# Super-Smash-Bros Lite
A slightly simplified edition of the classic fighting game. 

# Game Mechanics
Although the original Super Smash Bros offers a total of 89 playable characters and over 100 maps, this version consists of only Kirby and his rival Meta Knight as characters, and the map Final Destination as the only choice of battlefield. However, the game mechanics remain relatively true to the original, with the basic attacks, death animations, music, lives, and other features deviating little from those of the original. The controls are also exceedingly simple, consisting of only 5 keys for movement and attack, allowing for great accessibility. Built for the desktop instead of the console, the competitive spirit fostered by the original Smash game endures in this version of the game, and is sure to entertain any unscrupulous student.
